## Cypress commands are Promise-based

Actions are loosly enqueued and executed asynchronously. They can be chained to maintain the happens-before relationship

```javascript
it("has asynchronous APIs", () => {
  // This won't work - login button actions could execute first
  cy.get("#username").type("USERNAME");
  cy.get("#loginButton").click();

  // This will work as expected
  cy.get("#username")
    .type("USERNAME")
    .get("#loginButton")
    .click();
});
```
